  <p>Welcome to Olathe West High School, established in 2017, West emphasizes Project Based Learning (PBL) and has a wide variety of STEM related clubs, classes, and events. There are two CAD labs, two 21st Century Academies, technology integrated and centralized classes, and 11 Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathways. At Olathe West, we strive to expose students to unconventional learning, real-life situations/projects, and to help them find their interests.
</p>
 <p>“Olathe West opened in the fall of 2017, the fifth high school within the Olathe School District, designed using architecturally advanced techniques to create an innovative and futuristic learning environment for our students.  Spanning 375,000 square feet, our three-story school focuses on the use of technology, open, modular learning spaces, efficiency and collaboration among students.  A centrally-located learning commons provides student gathering and education collaboration spaces that connect to the entire building.  The school is designed with four wings, or communities, where students will attend classes.  The building also includes a media center, performing arts center, gymnasiums and practice fields for athletics.
Our school hosts two 21st century academies. These are programs developed by the Olathe School District to give students the ability to develop specific skills and interests. The two programs Olathe West hosts are Public Safety and Green Tech.”

  <p>Despite being only 2 years old, West has established many STEM clubs and traditions
</p>
 <p>Math Club	Pat Flynn: pjflynn@olatheschools.org</p>
<p>Math club is a place for students to challenge themselves mathematically with fun math related games, puzzles, and monthly competitions. If you’re worried about it being like Mean Girls, don’t worry! Our competitions are mostly written based, team competitions that do not require a buzzer. Meetings are held once a month on Tuesdays during power 50 A! Anyone from Geometry to Multivariable Calculus can join!
 </p>
 <p>Owl Maker Club	Melanie Massey: mamassey@olatheschools.org</p>
<p>The Owl Maker Club is a place for students to come and, well, make things! Come learn how to use a 3D printer, or fully utilize the Maker Spaces. Meetings are held every Wednesday during power 50 A, bring your friends and come blow off steam by creating, designing, and perfecting projects YOU want to do!
 </p>
 <p>TSA	Kevin Hulsen, John McDonald: kmhulsen@olatheschools.org</p>
<p>Technology Student Association is a club for anyone interested in STEM and then some! With over 30 events, there is a little bit of everything, from fashion design to coding to 3D animation to photographic technology. TSA emphasizes STEM, teamwork, leadership, and real life integration. Meetings are every other Thursday during Power 50 B in the CAD room!
 </p>
 <p>Dr. V’s OWL Chem Night</p>
<p>Dr. V’s OWL Chem Night is a bi yearly event for all students enrolled in Chemistry or Biology to show off their chemistry projects or biologic research projects. Students spend up to 4 months in preparation for respective events, with new first, second, and third place prizes every time. Dr. V and the other biology/chemistry teachers challenge their students to pick projects beyond those found on website and create their own in order to understand the scientific method and process.
